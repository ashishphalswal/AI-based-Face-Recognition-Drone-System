# AI-based-Face-Recognition-Drone-System
Developed an advanced AI-based face recognition system integrated with a Tello programmable drone for real-time surveillance and security applications. 

Technologies Used:  
    Programming Languages: Python Libraries: OpenCV, DeepFace, Tensorflow Database: SQLite

Drone Platform: Utilized the Tello programmable drone, known for its ease of use and flexibility in programming. The drone was equipped with a high-resolution camera for capturing video footage.

Face Detection and Recognition: Implemented face detection and recognition using deep learning models. The system employed OpenCV and Python to detect faces in real-time from the video feed. The facial data was processed using a pre-trained model to recognize and identify individuals.

Data Storage: Stored facial data in an SQLite database, which provided a lightweight and efficient solution for managing and querying face data. This allowed for quick retrieval and comparison of facial features during the recognition process.

Custom Control Interface: Developed a custom interface to control the drone. This interface allowed for manual and automated control of the drone’s movements, ensuring it could navigate and adjust its position to keep the detected face within the camera’s frame.

Live Streaming: Enabled live streaming of the video feed with real-time face recognition. This feature allowed for continuous monitoring and immediate identification of individuals, enhancing the system’s effectiveness in surveillance scenarios.
